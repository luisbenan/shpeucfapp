# SHPE @ UCF Mobile app Development

Creating an app to facilitate and assist SHPE @ UCF in their daily tasks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

#### Java 8 jdk if running an Android Virtual Device (Will not work with higher version as of when this was made) 
* To check your version open your Command Prompt/Terminal and run `java -version`
* Download [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* You need to set up **Java_Home** if this is your first time running java or have never done it before.
    * [MacOS](https://dalanzg.github.io/tips-tutorials/mac/2016/03/21/how-to-set-java_home-on-mac-os-x/) :desktop_computer:
    * [Windows](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/) :computer:

#### Android Studio to use an Android Virtual Device

* If you want to run on a physical device follow [this](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device) instead
* Download [here](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* Open up AVD(Android Virtual Device) manager and download an emulator. It doesn't really matter which one

#### XCode version 9.1+
* You can only download this on **MacOS** through the App store
* If you want to use a physical device follow [this](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device)
* Make sure you are signed in to your apple account and that your account is a [developer account](https://9to5mac.com/2016/03/27/how-to-create-free-apple-developer-account-sideload-apps/)!

#### Node 6
* MacOS:
   * Download HomeBrew [here](https://brew.sh/)
   * On your terminal write: `brew install node@6`
* Windows:
   * Download the file that ends with .msi [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v0.6.9/)
   * If that link doesn't work try looking for the version [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/)

#### Install git to get git command line access
* Install git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### Install react-native command line interface
* Open your Terminal/Command Prompt and run: `npm i -g react-native-cli`

#### Use this guide for great advice on creating cool UX/UI

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

#### Install the repository
* Open the terminal/Command Prompt and use `cd /path` to go to a folder. Preferably Desktop
* Type: `git clone https://github.com/SHPEUCF/shpeucfapp.git` :octocat:

#### Open the folder on the terminal/Command Prompt
* Open the terminal/Command Prompt and type: `cd {location of the repo}`

#### Install all dependencies
* Open the terminal/Command Prompt and type: `npm install`



## Running the app

#### :robot:Running on an Android simulator:

* Open up Android Studio
* Open up the AVD(Android Virtual Device) manager
* Run an emulator that you have downloaded already
* Open the terminal/Command Prompt, go to the repo and type: `react-native run-android`


#### :iphone:Running on an iOS simulator:
* Open the terminal/Command Prompt, go to the repo and type: `react-native run-ios`

### Debugging Setup :man_technologist:
#### JAVA_HOME missing on:
* [MacOS](https://dalanzg.github.io/tips-tutorials/mac/2016/03/21/how-to-set-java_home-on-mac-os-x/)
* [Windows](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t/)

#### ANDROID_HOME missing on:
* [MacOS(user2993582)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19986214/setting-android-home-enviromental-variable-on-mac-os-x)
* [Windows(Hoque MD Zahidul)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27620262/sdk-location-not-found-define-location-with-sdk-dir-in-the-local-properties-fil)

#### Print: Entry, ":CFBundleIdentifier", Does Not Exist:
1. Open the project on xCode which means to open: shpeucfapp/ios/shpeucfapp.xcodeproj
2. In xCode: File ->Workspace setting :hammer:
3. Change Build System to Legacy Build System and click OK
4. Follow these instructions:

5. In xCode: Product -> clean
6. In xCode: Click on the project folder on the left side-bar
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/t8v9oQy.png)
7. Make sure there are no errors by selecting a team and changing the bundle identifier if it's giving you an error
8. Close xCode and try running the simulator putting `react-native run-ios` on your terminal in the project folder
9. If step 6 doesn't work then try running `react-native run-ios` at least 2 more times
